# PHP-Flutter discord styling

*under construction*.

Simply download widgets and use them as you want. Also don't forget to import styles.

## Requires

This project was made with autoInclude. If you don't want to use autoInclude (found in autoInclude.php), you must import all the widgets, recursively (some widgets might need another widget to work).
Also note that some components have same name, but different namespace (such as title in head and in dataholders).
